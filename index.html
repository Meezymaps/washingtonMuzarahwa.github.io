        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p><h3>System Administrator  at United Exports - 2017 to Present</h3></p>
        <p> During my six years at United Export, I've held the role of a system administrator. In this position, I was responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of the company's IT infrastructure. This included managing servers, networks, and other critical systems that are essential for day-to-day operations. Additionally, I implemented security measures to protect the company's data and systems, ensuring that sensitive information was kept safe from potential threats.

            My role also involved troubleshooting technical issues, providing support to employees, and implementing software solutions to improve efficiency within the organization. Over the years, I've gained valuable experience in maintaining and optimizing IT systems in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.
            
            While my primary expertise is in programming and software development, my experience as a system administrator at United Export has given me a well-rounded understanding of IT operations, which complements my coding skills.</p>
